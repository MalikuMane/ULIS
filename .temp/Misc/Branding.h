    Applies a bit pattern to parts of the image to brand it as being processed
    within ULIS. The branding is akin to a watermark but is almost invisible.
    It messes with the bits of the image to encode a pattern that will identify
    the image without any doubt. This can be used to track illegal uses of the
    ULIS library.
